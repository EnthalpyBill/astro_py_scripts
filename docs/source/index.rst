How to contribute?
==================

**astro_py_scripts** is deployed on `GitHub <https://github.com/EnthalpyBill/astro_py_scripts>`_. You are more than welcome to contribute your own script! Just email us your script, or raise an issue/pull request. We recommend contributors to follow the following format:

Format
------

We highly recommend you to put everythong in a single ``.ipynb`` notebook. However, if extra files are needed, you should put all files in one folder. Once being deployed, your notebook will be stored as::

   docs/source/notebooks/name_of_your_folder/name_of_your_notebook.ipynb

Even if you only have one notebook, please also put it in a folder. Some of our post-processing codes rely on such hierarchy.

License
-------

Since **astro_py_scripts** is completely open source, you are recommended to have an `open source license <https://opensource.org/licenses>`_. Normally, the formal license file should be placed in the same folder as your notebook::

   docs/source/notebooks/name_of_your_folder/LICENSE

And, you can also briefly mention your license information in the notebook, something like "The copyright of this notebook belongs to Bill Chen under MIT license (see LICENSE)" is good enough.

Please make sure your license is compatible with **astro_py_scripts**, which is MIT license. Clearly, a GPL license is not compatible. Click `here <https://opensource.org/licenses>`_ for more information about licenses.
